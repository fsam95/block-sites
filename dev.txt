What's stopping you? 
  - I'm unfamiliar with the sdk 
  - And I don't know what my first step is 
    - My first step is to attach button (done) 
  - Now I need to figure out how to attach a panel to said button (done) 
  - What's the difference between contentScriptFile and contentURL 
    - contentURL is the link for the html file 
    - contentScriptFile is the javascript file 
    - important link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/High-Level_APIs/panel

- Now what? 
  - We need to write code for the content script, i suppose
